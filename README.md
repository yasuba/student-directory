Student Directory
=================

The student directory was the first project I worked on at Makers Academy. It is a simple ruby script that manages the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy. Through this project, I was introduced to the command line, Github and ruby.

The directory is able to: 

Show the list of all the students
Order them by name
Group them by cohort
Add new students by asking the user to input the names
Ask the user what he or she would like to do through an interactive menu
Save this data to a file
Load it from the file

How to use
-----------

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
